# Size of the high resolution mosaic: out_img = ENLARGEMENT * target_img
Enlargement = 10

# Maximum number of used tiles in the mosaic
Number of tiles = 1000

# Maximum number each image can be used in the mosaic
Maximum number of repetitions = 4

# Float between 0 and 1, how much the original image is blended over the mosaic
# negative number leads to automatic calculation of reasonable blend factor
Blending factor = 0.15

# Integer in [0-5]. How much the image may be altered by enhancing color, brightness and contrast. 0 is no modification allowed.
Modification factor = 0

# Tile Format as (width, height). (1,1) is quadratic tiles
Tile ratio = 1:1

# Performance Setting. 1 is fastest, 10 is slowest with possibly best fitting
Performance = 2
